# Moviepedia

Moviepedia is a php app that allows you to get movie information through console commands, it will display everything about the chosen movie as tabular data.

## Commands

To use the app you will need to use the show command. 
The command is used in the following way:
./moviepedia show "Movie title" --fullPlot
That will output the info of the movie referred to as the title.
The fullPlot command is optional, if you don't use it you will get a shorter plot summary of the movie instead of a full display.
